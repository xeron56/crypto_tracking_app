# README: Building and Running Flutter Code

This README guide provides instructions on how to set up and build Flutter code for your project. Flutter is a popular open-source framework developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and tools installed on your development machine:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice, such as:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Flutter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with the Flutter plugin
- Xcode (for macOS users, required for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xeron56/crypto_tracking_app
   cd crypto_tracking_app
   ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure IDE:

   - For Visual Studio Code, install the Flutter extension and Dart extension.
   - For Android Studio, ensure you have the Flutter plugin installed.

4. Android Setup (if you're developing for Android):

   - Connect a physical device via USB or use an Android emulator.
   - Run your Flutter app on the device/emulator:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

5. iOS Setup (if you're developing for iOS):

   - Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
   - Connect a physical iOS device or use the iOS simulator.
   - Select your device/simulator from the dropdown list.
   - Click the "Run" button to build and run your app.

## Project Structure

- **lib**: Contains the main Dart code for your application.
- **android**: Contains the Android-specific configuration and code.
- **ios**: Contains the iOS-specific configuration and code.
- **pubspec.yaml**: Specifies the Flutter dependencies and metadata for your project.
- **assets**: Directory to store assets like images, fonts, etc.
- **test**: Directory to write unit tests for your application.
